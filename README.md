# {{Project Name}}
> No-nonsense 1-sentence project description.

## Install
```sh
bower install readme
mv readme/README.md README.md
rm -vr readme
```
## Definition

What is this? Don't expect potential users to go through your code without prior explanation.

* Be specific, but don't be too technical yet.
* Don't skimp on hyperlinks. Google it for me. Add references to everything.
* Credit where it's due. We are all standing on the shoulders of giants.

Your [readme][WikiReadme] is not a blog post, if you want to compare your project to pirates or ninjas you have more than [several social artifacts](SocialMedia) at your disposal to express your creativity.

Writing technical specs should be akin to writing elegant algorithms. Be eloquent, but use [simple][SimpleWiki] vocabulary if you can.

## Why?

Sometimes _why_ can be more useful than _what_. Explain why this project exists and what problems it helps to solve. It's not about pitching your new MVC framework, it's about getting potential users to quickly understand the motivations and reasons behind your project.

## Getting Started / Usage

Spoon-feed. Don't puzzle readers with your mad code skills. List the most common use cases of your project. High _copy-paste_ factor for extra credits.

```js
var awe = require('your-awesome-module');
awe.befill(function(obj) {
  // Voila!
});
```

## Templates

  * [Simple][ReadmeSimple]

## Api
### `Namespace.awesome`

Light specs to get people acquainted with your API. _Optional._
